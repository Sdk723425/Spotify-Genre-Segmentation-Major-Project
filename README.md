# Spotify-Genre-Segmentation-Major-Project
This project clusters Spotify songs based on their audio features using KMeans. It performs data preprocessing and EDA to understand feature relationships. Clusters are visualized with PCA, and their distribution is analyzed by genre and playlist. A memory-efficient recommendation system is built using Nearest Neighbors to suggest similar songs.
